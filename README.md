This is my first game made using DragonRuby. It's a pet project
for the joy of learning on how to make games. 


So - follow me and the adventures of the little diver! 

The goal of the game is to survive and get mesmerized by the beauty of the underwater universe.

### Assets used

I'm highly thankful for the people that provided the lovely pixel art assets
I used in my game, like

* [SpearFishing by Szym](https://nszym.itch.io/spearfishing-assets-pack)
* [PixelArt Diver by Daniel Kole](https://dkproductions.itch.io/pixel-art-diver)

### How to run locally for development

For production we're building OS-specific binaries, but for 
development, if you have dragonruby locally, then:

```sh
./dragonruby app
```
